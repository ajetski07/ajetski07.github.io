          Hello, my name is Adam Jeske, I am 34 years old and I was born and raised
          in Sacramento, CA. I love to be outdoors more often than not, be it skateboarding,
          mountain biking, hiking whatever, just anything to get me outside. I also prefer
          the mountains over the city more times than not, even in the winter when they are
          covered in snow because that just means fresh powder for shredding. 
        </p>

        <p>For the last few years I have been working in the music and entertainment industry
          on the logistical side of touring. I work with the road crew to ensure that they have
          what they need for the tour. I had dabbled in coding in the past on my own using things
          like code school, etc. But after a few unhappy years in my current industry I am ready to
          take my skills to the next level and look for a career change.
        </p>
